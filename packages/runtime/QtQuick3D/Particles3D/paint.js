// What a View3D draws of a particle system besides its models: the sprites,
// each a square of `particleScale` times the particle's size with the
// picture on it, and the lines, each a ribbon along the way a particle
// came. They are drawn among what is seen through in the view, a system
// as far away as it is itself, with a program of their own: behind what is
// nearer, and in front of nothing as far as what is drawn later can tell.
//
// As Qt draws a sprite: where the particle is in the system is where the
// middle of the square is, and the square itself is turned as the particle
// is and no other way, in the scene (`billboard` not set: it lies in the
// scene's own plane whichever way the system is turned and however big it
// is) or before the eye (`billboard`). Its colour is taken as it is for
// light and goes through the view's tone mapping.
//
// And a line: it is kept from one time the system is brought to to the
// next, a point of it put down where the particle is each time it has come
// far enough from the last, so what a line is depends on the times the
// system went through, as it does in Qt. Its sums are Qt's. Unlike Qt, a
// line is only kept while a view draws it: one that nothing looked at
// begins where it is first seen.
