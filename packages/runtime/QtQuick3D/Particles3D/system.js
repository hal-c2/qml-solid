// ParticleSystem3D: the time particles live in. It has the emitters, the
// affectors and the kinds of particle that are declared in it or name it as
// their `system`, and what there is of each kind is what the emitters have
// emitted by its time and what the affectors make of that at its time.
//
// While it is `running` the time goes by itself, from nought; stopped, the
// time is what `time` is given, and a system whose time is moved to and
// fro shows at each time what it was brought to by the times before, as in
// Qt: emitting is done once for each time it comes to, and looking at a
// particle is done from its start alone.
//
// Unlike Qt: a time that is set is the system's time at once, where Qt's
// system comes to it with the next frame. An emitter that is enabled or
// asked for a burst right after the time was set starts from the new time
// here, and from the old one in Qt.
