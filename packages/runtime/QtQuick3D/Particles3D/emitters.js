// What makes particles: an emitter gives each one it emits a start, a life,
// a place, a speed, a turn, a size and a colour, and the particle's kind
// keeps them. So many a second, and in bursts.
//
// How many and when is Qt's own arithmetic, found by asking Qt 6.11 for the
// particles there are after the time was moved in steps: what was emitted
// since the last time is spread evenly over the time since, an emitter that
// has not a whole particle to emit waits where it was, and no more of the
// past is made up for than a particle's longest life.
//
// Emitters and affectors do their work the last declared first, as Qt's
// do, where each comes to its system when it is complete and the last made
// is complete first. And an emitter that has bursts empties its kind of
// particle before the first thing it emits, as Qt's does: of several
// emitters of one kind that have bursts, what the earlier declared emits
// first is all there is then.
//
// A TrailEmitter3D is Qt 6.11's step for step (`trail`), and so not what
// its documentation says: a burst that is to come when a particle followed
// starts or ends comes at its `time` as well; of a model, the one for an
// end comes again every time the system moves on while the particle that
// ended has its place in the table, and the one for a start only for a
// particle with no life at all; of a sprite or a line both come once.
//
// Not here: `emitMode` and `depthBias` are kept and do nothing: a particle
// sets off as `velocity` says whatever surface it starts on.
