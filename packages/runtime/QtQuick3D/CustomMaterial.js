// CustomMaterial: a material drawn by shaders of the scene's own.
//
// It names two files, each a piece of a shader as Qt has them written
// (`shaders.js` says how), or is given the text of one where it names no
// file (`__vertexShaderCode`, `__fragmentShaderCode`: what a material
// written in QML puts its shaders together in), and whether what they draw
// is lit as a PrincipledMaterial is (`Shaded`) or is the colour they say
// (`Unshaded`).
// What the shaders are handed besides is the material's own properties,
// those its QML declares: each is a uniform of its name, of the type Qt
// makes of the property's (a `real` a `float`, a `color` a `vec4` in linear
// light, a `TextureInput` a `sampler2D`).
//
// Nothing is seen through what one draws unless it says how it is blended
// (`sourceBlend` and `destinationBlend`, both), whatever the opacity of its
// model: Qt has it so.
//
// Not here: lines of any width but one (`lineWidth`), which a browser does
// not draw, and a property with no value of a type that says nothing of
// what it would be (`property vector2d wind` alone), which is no uniform
// until it has one.
