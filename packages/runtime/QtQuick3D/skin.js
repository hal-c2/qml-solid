// What bends a shape: a Skin, whose joints are nodes anywhere in the scene,
// and the older Skeleton, whose joints are the Joint nodes inside it. Each
// corner of a mesh says which joints it goes with and how much with each
// (`attr_joints`, `attr_weights`), and is moved as they are.
//
// What a joint does to a corner is where the joint is in the scene now,
// after its inverse bind pose: where it was when the mesh was made, undone.
// A shape that is bent is placed by its joints alone: where its own Model is
// does not come into it, as it does not in Qt.
//
// A MorphTarget is how much a Model goes towards one of the other shapes its
// mesh has of itself: the first of a Model's is for the mesh's first, and so
// on. What it says it is of (`attributes`) is kept and changes nothing
// drawn, as it changes nothing in Qt 6.11: a shape goes towards all its mesh
// has for a target.
