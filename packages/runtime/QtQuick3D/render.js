// Draws a scene in space, as a View3D found it, with WebGL.
//
// Every view is drawn by one context, of which a page may have few, and what
// was drawn is handed to the view's own canvas, as a ShaderEffect's is.
//
// What is drawn is lit as Qt lights it: each light's share of a surface's
// colour by how far the surface faces it, the shine of it by Qt's own sums,
// and the whole brought from linear light to the screen's by Qt's tone
// mapping. What nothing is seen through is drawn first, nearest first; what
// something is, after, farthest first.
//
// A scene may be lit by its surroundings besides its lights: a picture of
// everything round it (a light probe), which is folded into a cube and that
// blurred as Qt blurs it, once for each step of roughness and once for what
// a rough surface takes from all round. The same cube is what is behind the
// scene where its background is a sky box.
//
// Under an ExtendedSceneEnvironment a scene is drawn in linear light, into
// a picture whose numbers are fractions, and brought to the screen after:
// which a browser that cannot draw into such a picture does not do, and
// there the scene is drawn as under a SceneEnvironment.
//
// A surface that is lit is in the scene's fog, where it has one. One that
// is not lit, and what is behind the scene, are not, as in Qt.
//
// A shape drawn by a table of instances is drawn once for each entry, by
// one call: where each is and what colour it is times are the entry's.
//
// What a CustomMaterial draws is drawn by a program of its own, made of its
// shaders and this file's (`shaders.js`), and put over what is there as the
// material says. One that reads what is behind it has that drawn for it
// first: the scene without what something is seen through, in linear light,
// and how far each place of it is.
//
// A model that takes reflections and is in the box of a reflection probe
// mirrors the scene as it is seen from the probe: which is drawn for it
// first, through each side of a cube, as it is lit and in linear light, and
// the cube blurred for what is rough, as that of a light probe is but over
// fewer ways. Such a model takes of the cube what it would have taken of
// the light probe, and of that nothing.
//
// An environment's effects are run over the picture once the scene is
// drawn, one after another: the scene is drawn in linear light for them, as
// under an ExtendedSceneEnvironment, each pass of each draws a rectangle
// over the whole of what it draws into with the effect's shaders, and what
// the last leaves is brought to the screen. Where a browser cannot draw
// into a picture of fractions they are not run.
//
// Not here: a probe that is a canvas is folded once, as it is when first
// drawn, and a material's own probe is not looked at. What a CustomMaterial
// draws mirrors nothing by a reflection probe, and what nodes draw by
// themselves is not in what one sees. Of what an effect may read besides
// the picture, only how far each place of it is: which is how far what
// nothing is seen through is.
