// QtQuick3D.Helpers.impl: what Qt's ExtendedSceneEnvironment.qml is made
// of that Qt has in C++. A SceneEffectEnvironment is a SceneEnvironment
// that does not bring what is drawn to the screen as each thing is drawn:
// the scene is drawn in linear light, and the effect that says it is the
// environment's (a MainSceneEffect) brings the whole picture to the screen
// afterwards. What that effect is to do it has as properties, by the names
// Qt's SceneEffect.qml gives them, and those are read here.
//
// Of what it does these are here: how exposed the picture is (`exposure`),
// the tone mapping and its white point (`tonemapMode`, `white`), smoothing
// of edges (`applyFXAA`), sharpening (`sharpnessAmount`), dithering,
// brightness, contrast and saturation, and the vignette.
//
// Not here: glow, lens flare, the colour table (`enableLut`), and the three
// effects before it: depth of field, and the light and the reflections
// worked out from the picture (DepthOfFieldEffect, SsgiEnvEffect,
// SsrEnvEffect), which are held and do nothing.
