// QtGraphs' graphs in space. What is expected is what Qt 6.11 says and draws
// for the same QML: each `graph3d*.qml` scene is run by `qml6` too, asked the
// same and grabbed after each step. `fixtures/graphs3d.json` is what it said
// and `fixtures/graphs3d/` its pictures. The labels are of the test font,
// whose letters are boxes.
//
// Two renderers do not draw a picture alike to the pixel. A pixel counts as
// another when it is more than 16 levels from Qt's: the light on a wall, a
// bar or a point is within that of Qt's, and what is left is edges. Qt's
// lines are smoothed and a pixel wide wherever they fall, and those here are
// on whole pixels, so a line that falls between two differs all along; the
// edges of labels, of walls and of what is plotted differ by a pixel, Qt's
// bars have their edges cut, and a surface that is shaded smoothly is lit a
// little otherwise. That is between 4000 and 17000 of a picture's 240000
// pixels, most where the lines are many, and each picture may differ by a
// tenth more than it does. A graph whose points alone are elsewhere differs
// by 12000 from a picture that is under 6000 from its own, and one that is
// turned or zoomed otherwise by more.
