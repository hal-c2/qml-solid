// one tracks it like any signal, so a binding that reads `other.width` is
// re-evaluated when that width changes, whatever made it change.
//
// A type is a Solid component: called with props, it returns the object. The
// compiler emits `<Rectangle color="red"/>`, Solid turns that into
// `createComponent(Rectangle, { color: "red" })`, and nothing here interprets
// QML: names and scopes were settled when the file was compiled.
