// What a property is between two keyframes, by the type of the property.
//
// Qt asks the property for its type and interpolates what `QVariantAnimation`
// can: numbers, colours, points, sizes, rectangles, vectors and quaternions.
// Anything else keeps the value of the keyframe before until the next one is
// reached. Here a property has no type to ask for, so it is taken from the
// value the property had when the timeline took it over.
//
// Not here, for that reason:
// - `property int`: Qt cuts what it interpolates down to a whole number; here
//   it is a number like any other.
// - `property var`: Qt interpolates nothing and the property reads undefined
//   up to its last keyframe; here it goes by the value it holds.
// - a property with no value yet (a `property color` nothing was given)
//   jumps from keyframe to keyframe.
