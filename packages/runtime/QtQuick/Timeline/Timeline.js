// Timeline, KeyframeGroup, Keyframe: properties that are what their keyframes
// say at `currentFrame`, for as long as the timeline is enabled.
//
// As Qt does it. A group takes its property over when the timeline is
// enabled: it remembers the value the property has and the binding it had,
// and from then on writes what its keyframes make of the frame, whenever the
// frame or a keyframe changes. Before its first keyframe the property is on
// its way there from the value it had, which stands just before
// `startFrame`; each keyframe's easing curve is that of the way to it; past
// the last keyframe it is that one's value. Disabled, the group gives back
// what it took, the binding if there was one, but only where the property
// still reads what the group last wrote: what something else has written
// since stays. Groups are done in the order they are written, so a second one
// on a property takes over what the first has just written.
//
// What is written is an assignment like a program's: a Behavior on the
// property animates it.
//
// Not here:
// - `KeyframeGroup.keyframeData`.
// - `keyframeSource` is read as Qt reads it, but the browser fetches it:
//   its keyframes are there some time after the group is made, where Qt has
//   them at once. Given another source, Qt drops the keyframes written
//   inside the group too; here they stay.
// - Qt warns of a property it cannot set at every frame; here once.
// - The property's type is not known, only its value: see between.js.
// - `Timeline.keyframeGroups` and `animations` are what was written in the
//   timeline; nothing can be added to them afterwards.
