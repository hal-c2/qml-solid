// TimelineAnimation: a NumberAnimation of a timeline's `currentFrame`.
//
// What it adds, as Qt does it:
// - It is the animation of the timeline whose `animations` it is in, and
//   starting it stops the timeline's others.
// - `finished` is its own signal, and comes whenever it stops, on its own or
//   told to: after `stopped`, before `running` is told to have changed.
// - `pingPong`: there and back again is one loop. Each way is a run of its
//   own, started when the one before has stopped, so `stopped` and `started`
//   come between them and `finished` only after the last; while it goes on,
//   `loops` reads 1, and on the way back `from` and `to` read each other's.
//   `running` is told again, as true, each time it turns round. Stopped by
//   hand it is over.
//
// Not here: `pingPong` does nothing in an animation that is not in a
// timeline's `animations`; what Qt makes of one there was not measured.
