// An item's layer: `layer.enabled` and `layer.effect`.
//
// Qt draws an item that has a layer into a texture, and where the layer has
// an effect, makes one, gives it that texture as its `source` and draws it
// in the item's stead: where the item is, as big, turned and scaled as it
// is. A page cannot draw its own elements into a texture. So the item goes
// on being drawn itself, and its effect is drawn under it: a shadow shows
// around the item and through it, as it does in Qt. What an effect does with
// its source is its own to say: a MultiEffect does it to the item's own
// element, a ShaderEffect draws what it would of nothing, but for an item
// that is a picture, a canvas or another effect, which it has to draw: the
// item is then drawn over what the effect made of it.
//
// A layer with no effect is the item drawn as one thing, which is what a
// page does with an element in any case.
