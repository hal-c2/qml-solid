// button is down, if there is such a file.

// The selector owns what the property reads as (the slot's `shown`): the

// Qt looks in a folder for the files there are. A page has no folders to
// look in: a file is there if the build said so (`resources`), as it does of
// the pictures a style of Qt's keeps in its plugin.
